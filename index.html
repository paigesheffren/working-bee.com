        <strong>Is Working Bee available yet?</strong>
        <p>
          Working Bee is in the concept & formulation stage. Final products
          will only launch once compliant with Canadian regulations and fully tested.

        <strong>Will it replace traditional pre-workout?</strong>
        <p>
          The goal is to offer an alternative format. Users will be instructed to
          follow label directions and consider total daily caffeine from all sources.
